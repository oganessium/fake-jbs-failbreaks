# Fake Jailbreaks
Documentation on fake iOS jailbreak utilities, as well as some utilities that are generally not recommended for use. Use any of these AT YOUR OWN RISK; I would not recommend any of them to anyone.
#### iXintpwn/YJSNPI
iXintpwn, also referred to as Xintpwn, YJSNPI or Beast Senpai, is a malicious profile that can be downloaded straight from any iOS device and installed through the Settings App. It was not always masked as a jailbreak utility, but was sometimes disguised as such and did trick many people seeking a jailbreak tool. The original Xintpwn used blob objects to try to hide its malicious configuration profile. It contains 166 web-clips and disables deleting the profile. Web clips are essentially apps that load a webpage of some sort, and in this case the apps installed load a larger picture of its app icon. When initialized 166 apps will indeed appear on the device and cause an immense amount of lag and delay until a freeze occurs. This malicious fake jailbreak can be removed using Apple Configurator 2 for macOS.
#### XigTeam
XigTeam is a jailbreak for supposedly iOS 10.3.x. Support for both iOS 10 and iOS 11 was teased by them at various points. Little information is known as of now, but the tool they showed was a PC/Mac utility that only supported the iPhone 7 and above, which was very odd. Various websites cropped up, such as http://xigjailbreak.com/, but their "official" twitter page @XigTeam (now deleted) denied that the team had a public website. They kept giving ETAs and pushing back on time, until eventually they were set for release on Wednesday, September 13th. Up until then they denied being fake and kept showing preview videos of Cydia running until on September 11th (likely planned in retrospect) their twitter profile morphed into a parody of Tim Cook, confirming that the entire team was a hoax.
#### Spring
Spring/Spring10 is a tool made by the YouTube channel Develop Apple for iOS 10.3.x. The channel DevelopApple was showing videos of an early jailbreak, simply titled "Jailbreak by DevelopApple," as early as July 22nd, 2017. However, there were no betas of this tool ever released, making it very suspicious as this seemingly came out of nowhere. The jailbreak later was named Spring and picked up more steam as zIVA, an exploit made by Adam Donenfeld, was released publicly. Now Spring was sold as using exploits like zIVA and triple_fetch by Ian Beer, but there was still little proof of it being real and many were skeptical. For a while DevelopApple did not release much about this jailbreak. Later, v0rtex was released as an exploit for iOS 10.x. The g0blin jailbreak was released publicly for all iDevices shortly after for 10.3.x, being the first major jailbreak for these versions. DevelopApple saw this is a chance to satisfy his critics by effectively taking the open source code of g0blin and changing the layout to Spring10, a 10.3.x jailbreak. In the end, the JB was *technically* not fake, but it was not original work and, before g0blin's release, was likely fake.
